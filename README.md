## REST Architecture
## Step 1: Installation of Tools
To deploy a REST-based application, you need to install the following:
Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager):
Mac/Linux: `sudo apt install nodejs npm`
Windows:
Download and install Node.js from the official website.
Express.js (Node.js framework):
After installing Node.js, install Express: `npm install express --save`
## Step 2: Creating the REST Project
Clone the project: Clone this project using Git.
Initialize the project: Initialize the project with npm start.
Start the server: Start the server with node app.js.
Test the application: Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000/name. You should see your name on the screen.
